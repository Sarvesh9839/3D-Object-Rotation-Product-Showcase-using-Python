# 3D-Object-Rotation-Product-Showcase-using-Python
Real-time 3D object rotation (manual &amp; auto-rotate)
🚗 3D Object Rotation Product Showcase (2D Simulation using Turtle Graphics)
A Python-based graphical demonstration simulating a rotating 3D car using 2D turtle graphics. This lightweight showcase illustrates the concept of object rotation and real-time rendering—ideal for educational purposes or simple animation prototypes.

🎯 Features:
🔁 Smooth rotation of a stylized 2D car body

🛞 Realistic wheel rendering with animated spokes

🎨 Customizable color scheme for car body, windows, and wheels

💡 Real-time rendering using trigonometric transformation

🐢 Built entirely using Python's built-in turtle module—no external libraries required

🧠 Learning Objectives:
Understanding 2D rotational transformations

Simulating 3D motion in a 2D canvas

Efficient real-time graphics with Python’s turtle and math modules

📦 Tech Stack:
Language: Python 3.x

Graphics Engine: Turtle Graphics (Standard Library)
